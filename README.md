Artemis2BSdNmod
===============

Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator Mod for Artemis 2.0 with new ships using existing models.
This mod was created for BridgeSim.net.

How-to install/use files.

Recommend copying the Artemis directory (from c:\Program Files\) to a new directory like Artemis2BSdNMod or the like.

Then copy the contents of "dat" to the "dat" in the new directory you just created. Overwrite existing files. 
Create a new shortcut to Artemis.exe to make it easier to launch.
